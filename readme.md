# Algorithm challenges in javascript

## Instructions
 - Don't edit the index.html and test.js file
 - All codes should be written in the challenge.js file
 - Functions has already been created, don't add extra parameters or rename the function
 - Ensure you return the final output

## Challenge 1: find longest word in a sentence
In the challenge.js file, a function findLongestWordLength has been created.
Sample input1: findLongestWordLength("Javascript is a fun language")
Expected output1: "Javascript"

Sample input2: findLongestWordLength("solving problems is a good way to learn")
Expected output2: "solving" (It returns the first element if more than one element have the same length)

## Challenge 2: Get the largest elements in an array as an array
Input format: An multidimensional array (an array of arrays e.g [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]). You're expected to return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array
In the challenge.js file, a function findLargestOfArrays has been created, your implementation should be in the function
Sample input1: findLargestOfArrays([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]])
Expected output1: [2, 3, 4]

Sample input2: findLargestOfArrays([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 18, 0, 12], [3, 5, 12, 5], [28, 9, 2, 34]])
Expected output2: [4, 18, 12, 34]
