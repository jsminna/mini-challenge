# Algorithm challenges in javascript

## Instructions

- Don't edit the index.html and test.js file
- All codes should be written in the challenge.js file
- Functions has already been created, don't add extra parameters or rename the function
- Ensure you return the final output
- Fork the repo
- On your terminal, git clone https://github.com/your_username/mini-challenge/
- Work on the challenge, and make a pull request
- Open index.html in your terminal to run the test cases

## Challenge 1: find longest word in a sentence

In the challenge.js file, a function findLongestWordLength has been created.

> Sample input1: findLongestWordLength("Javascript is a fun language")  
> Expected output1: "Javascript"

> Sample input2: findLongestWordLength("solving problem is a good way to learn")  
> Expected output2: "solving" (It returns the first element if more than one element have the same length)

## Challenge 2: Get the largest elements in an array as an array

Input format: An multidimensional array (an array of arrays e.g [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]). You're expected to return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array
In the challenge.js file, a function findLargestOfArrays has been created, your implementation should be in the function

> Sample input1: findLargestOfArrays([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]])  
> Expected output1: [2, 3, 4]

> Sample input2: findLargestOfArrays([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 18, 0, 12], [3, 5, 12, 5], [28, 9, 2, 34]])  
> Expected output2: [4, 18, 12, 34]
